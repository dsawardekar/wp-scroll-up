Adds a Button to Scroll back to Top of any Post or Page in WordPress.

== Description ==

Adds a Scroll To Top button that allows visitors to scroll back to the
top of the page. You can customize the button style using predefined
styles or by adding a custom CSS file in your Theme.

== Installation ==

1. Click Plugins > Add New in the WordPress admin panel.
1. Search for "wp-scroll-up" and install.

### Customization ###

The *Style* dropdown changes the button style displayed. These
correspond to CSS styles present in the plugin's CSS directory.

When you choose the *Custom* style, the plugin automatically adds the
CSS file located at *{current_theme}/wp-scroll-up/custom.css*.

This CSS file must contain an ID selector, *#scrollUp* and it's custom
style attributes. For instance, the bundled `image` style is provided by the
CSS,

    /* Image style */
    #scrollUp {
      bottom: 20px;
      right: 20px;
      height: 38px; /* Height of image */
      width: 38px; /* Width of image */
      background: url(../img/top.png) no-repeat;
    }

Other settings that can be changed,

* Scroll Text: The text label of the button.
* Scroll Distance: The number of pixels that a user needs to scroll
  before they see the button.
* Scroll Speed: Duration in milliseconds to scroll to top.
* Animation: Whether the scroll button should Fade in/out
